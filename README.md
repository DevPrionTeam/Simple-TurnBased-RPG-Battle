It contains a simple system of probabilities and enemy IA too.
But for now the enemy just attack the player.

Player has : 
- HP 
- LVL 
- Damage power

The enemy has the same things that player have, but except for the EXP, which will cannot be added dynamically for now.

As the time passes, this sample will be receiving updates like :
- Enemy defending himself.
- Player defend action.
- Player level up system.
- More Enemies
And Much more, so stay tunned ;D

See you guys in the next update !
